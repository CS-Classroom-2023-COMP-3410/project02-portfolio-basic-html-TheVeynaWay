Overall my project theme was nature and the outdoors and I did my best to incorportate as much nature as possible given the requirements. As a whole I didn't have that much trouble with any specific part, the in-class #2 set me up well to complete this project. The part I had the most trouble with was coming up with a theme and figuring out how to encorporate it in every page. My development process was first making sure I completed the required pages and elements, then I went back through adding my theme and finally I added my two personal files of "How to Backpack!" and "Photo Gallery".
