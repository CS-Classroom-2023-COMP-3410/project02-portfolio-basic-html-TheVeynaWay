        <h2><u>General Procedure</u></h2>
        <!--a general procedure section that explains the steps to follow to go backpacking in order-->
        <ol>
            <li>Find a place to backpack, I generally use AllTrails but similar apps would work</li>
            <li>Figure out if you need a permit to backpack in this area, usually can find easily online</li>
            <li>Create a list of what you need to pack in your backpack</li>
            <li>Come up with simple, light, easy meals to eat</li>
            <li>Make sure you have plenty of water or ability to make clean water with a filter, boiling, or other method</li>
            <li>Once you are backpacking, make sure you find a place to set up your tent or sleep that is out of the elements</li>
            <li>Make sure your food is stored away from your campsite, preferably high in a tree out on a tree limb</li>
            <li>Enjoy your backpacking trip!</li>
        </ol>

                    <ul>
                    <li>Make sure you have properly researched the trail to understand distance, elevation gain, composition of terrain, and weather in that area (I have learned the hard way a few times)</li>
                    <li>Try your best to stay dry in cold weather because it's very hard to get warm when wet</li>
                    <li>Only pack the essentials and things you need to save weight, your back will thank you</li>
                    <li>Work your way up towards harder and longer backpacking trips</li>
                    <li>Make sure you let loved ones or freinds know where you're going in case something goes wrong, another option is having a satellite device</li>
